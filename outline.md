# What is NumPy?
 - Numerical computation library for Python
   - CPU-based, in-memory
 - Foundational component of SciPy ecosystem
### Links/Resources
 - numpy.org (new site by then?)
### Questions
 - How many audience members are python users? Daily users?
 - How many audience members use scipy ecosystem? Daily?

# History of NumPy
 - Mid 90's -> Desire for numerical computation in Python leads to Numeric
 - Early 2000's -> T. Oliphant adds packages build on top of Numeric array
 - 2001 -> SciPy project to unify above efforts in dev of scientific libs in 
   python
 - Early adopters include Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) - Hubble folks
   - Specific needs result in development of Numarray package
 - 2005 -> Numeric & Numarray unified to become Numpy
 - N.b. originally called scipy.core (i.e. foundational component)
 - 2006 -> NumPy vers. 1.0

# NumPy Features
 - ndarray
 - libraries of methods for common numerical tasks
   - np.random - random number generation
   - np.linalg - routines for linear algebra
   - np.fft    - discrete fourier transform
     * Apollo image denoising example from elegant scipy

# NumPy Now
 - Show packages that depend on numpy
   - Scientific python ecosystem
   - Data science/AI libraries
   - TODO: Find research projects @ UM
