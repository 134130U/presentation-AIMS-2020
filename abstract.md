# NumPy: A look at the past, present, and future of array computation

November 2019 marked the 13th anniversary of the release of NumPy 1.0. 
What started as humble project to bring efficient array computation to Python
driven by a dedicated core of user-developers has since transformed into
a foundational component of the widely-adopted scientific python ecosystem,
displacing commercially-developed software across many STEM disciplines.
The recent explosion of interest in data science and machine learning has
further accelerated the pace of adoption, resulting in an estimated 10-15
million users from an even wider range of fields.
From the beginning, NumPy's n-dimensional array object has been the standard
exchange object for data within the scientific python ecosystem.
The NumPy Array API has seen similarly wide adoption, becoming the *de facto*
standard for array computation libraries in the wider ecosystem.
The past few years has seen the rapid development of many libraries that
improve the speed, flexibility, and scalability of array computation.
Facilitating developments along these lines while mitigating the risk of
ecosystem fragmentation is one of the central goals for the NumPy developers.
This talk presents the development arc of the NumPy library, starting with a
brief look at the history and philosophy of the project and tracing its
evolution to the present day.
We will present the core features of the NumPy library and take a look at some
recent ground-breaking scientific discoveries that depend on NumPy and
the scientific python ecosystem.
We conclude with a look at the future of NumPy, including proposed and 
actively developed enhancements, as well as the long-term outlook
and direction.
NumPy has always been a community-driven project: we hope to inspire you to 
join the community and help steer array computation (and the tens of millions
of users who depend on it) to a bright future!
