# NumPy: A look at the past, present, and future of array computation

November 2019 marked the 13th anniversary of the release of NumPy 1.0.
What started as humble project to bring efficient array computation to
Python driven by a dedicated core of user-developers has since
transformed into a foundational component of the widely-adopted
scientific Python ecosystem, even displacing commercially-developed
software across many STEM disciplines.
The recent explosion of interest in data science and machine learning
has further accelerated its pace of adoption, resulting in an
estimated 10-15 million users from a wide range of fields.

Since its inception, NumPy's n-dimensional array object has been the
standard exchange object for data within the scientific Python
ecosystem.
Recent years have seen the rapid development of numerous libraries
that improve the speed, flexibility, and scalability of array
computation.
Among them, NumPy's API emerged as a common language for expressing
array operations.
Mitigating the risk of ecosystem fragmentation, while encouraging
development of a diverse ecosystem of libraries and technologies, is
one of the central goals of the NumPy developers.

This talk presents the development arc of the NumPy library, starting with a
brief look at the history and philosophy of the project and tracing its
evolution to the present day.
We will present the core features of the NumPy library and take a look at some
recent ground-breaking scientific discoveries that depend on NumPy and
the scientific Python ecosystem.
We conclude with a look at the future of NumPy, including proposed and 
actively developed enhancements.
NumPy has always been a community-driven project: we hope to inspire you to 
join the community and help steer array computation (and the tens of millions
of users who depend on it) to a bright future!
