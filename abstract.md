November 2019 marked the 13th anniversary of the release of NumPy 1.0. 
What started as humble project to bring efficient array computation to Python
driven by a dedicated core of user-developers has since transformed into
a foundational component of the widely-adopted scientific python ecosystem,
displacing commercially-developed software across many STEM disciplines.
The recent explosion in data science and machine learning has further 
accelerated the pace of adoption, resulting in an estimated 10-15 million
users from an even wider range of fields.
NumPy's central data structure, the n-dimensional array, has become
the *de facto* standard for array computation libraries that offer exciting
capabilities in improved speed and scalability of array computation.
The rapid proliferation of these tools in recent years
necessitates further evolution of NumPy to better facilitate these developments
while mitigating fragmentation of the ecosystem.
This talk presents the development arc of the NumPy library, starting with a
brief look at the history and philosophy of the project and tracing its
evolution to the present day.
We will present the core features of the NumPy library and take a look at some
recent ground-breaking scientific discoveries that have depended on NumPy and
the scientific python ecosystem.
We conclude with a look at the future of NumPy, including enhancements that
are proposed and being actively developed, as well as the long-term outlook
and direction.
NumPy has always been a community-driven project: we hope to inspire you to 
join the community and help steer array computation (and the tens of millions
of users who depend on it) to a bright future!
